Why do bad things happen to good people?  #cowboys
dude was on saying the us gov's promise to lay groundwork for private space mining w. reactive rather than predictive regulation is "good"
@dreamyhoe the fact that u realize this is such a big step tho, some are so stuck in it that they cant even see how bad of a habit it can be
@WEWANTURIHOCKEY maybe l, but i don't see why turgeon and UM would care if it were nothing.
@II_VI_MCMXCI the food was worth it though
@Salvo_Motionz LMFAO Motionz ur weird
I think Romo just broke his clavicle again from the way he's holding that arm.
